  <p class="title">A brainfuck interpreter in PHP</p>
  
  <p class="smalltitle">Introduction</p>
  
  <p class="text">Brainfuck is a turing-complete programming language with only <span class="notice">eight instructions</span>.</p>

  <p class="text"><a href="http://wuarchive.wustl.edu/~umueller/" target="_blank">Urban Müller</a>, who invented
    this language, aimed to create a compiler which was as small as possible. And he indeed succeeded
	to create a compiler on his Amiga which was only 240 Bytes long. Since then ports to many
	different platforms have been made. The language itself is <a href="http://www.google.com/search?q=turing+machine" target="_blank">turing-complete</a>
    and thus capable of performing any arbitrary computation. </p>

  <p class="text">Brainfuck's unusual name might lead you to think of it as a preposterous and absurd invention. In
    fact, Brainfuck was meant to be named "Mental Masturbation" first, but he then stuck to "Brainfuck".</p>

  <p class="text">What makes brainfuck fascinating is it's minimalistic, but not limiting set of instructions. The
    language is absolutely redundance-free, i.e. no instruction could be replaced by another. There is still more
	than one way of doing it (<a href="http://www.wall.org/~larry/" target="_blank">Larry Wall</a>&trade;) but the
	language constructs itself are unique and not interchangeable.</p>
	
  <p class="text">For example, brainfuck will only provide you a loop instruction. You will then discover that
    a condition ("if") is basically a loop which either gets executed once or never. An "else" could be implemented
	by checking whether the "if" condition was true or not. Adding 5 to 3 is running through a loop 5 times while
	increasing 3 by one every time. You will start spending hours implementing basic language constructs you
	know from other languages, but now actually <span class="notice">understand</span> how they might work on a
	much lower, machine-level. Eventually, you might even implement some more complex algorithms.</p>
	
  <p class="text">Brainfuck is not meant to be a "productive language". Programming BF is uncomfortable, sometimes
    even tedious, but it allows you to express complex problems with only a minimalistic vocabulary. Or did you every
	try to quote Shakespeare with only eight words while still <span class="notice">preserving accuracy</span>?
	It is not an easy task, but it's certainly entertaining and a worthwhile thing to do. Besides, who else can
	enter pages of apparently incomprehensible code which actually produce some cool output?</p>
	
  <p class="smalltitle">Motivation</p>
    
  <p class="text">My motivation was to prove whether PHP was capable of interpreting another language at decent
    speed - and of course to challenge myself (as usual). I strictly only relied on low-level functions (instead
	of using for example regular expressions) which make this proof more accurate.</p>

  <p class="text">Not surprisingly, the result is significantly slower than compareable interpreters written
    in C. But it is still fast enough to run semi-complex BF scripts at useful speed.</p>
	
  <p class="text">As far as I'm informed, there is no other language written in PHP which does parsing
    itself (although I could be proven wrong here. <a href="mailto:dlorch@gmail.com" target="_blank">Contact me</a> in such case, as
	this topic does really interest me). There is a Meta-language by Manuel Lemos called
	<a href="http://www.meta-language.net/" target="_blank">MetaL</a>, but it relies on PHP's internal
	XML parser. To be honest, I don't expect any other sane human being to write a parser in PHP,
	as this is not only slow, but also terribly useless. The usual approach to add functionality to
	PHP is to write a module in C.</p>

  <p class="smalltitle">Implementation</p>
  
  <p class="text">This chapter will teach you how to <span class="notice">invoke</span> the brainfuck
   interpreter (the actual BF syntax is covered in the next two chapters).</p>
  
  <p class="text">The brainfuck interpreter is a function which takes as a first argument the BF script.
    It will return the script output as a string. For example, the following lines will produce the famous
	"Hello World" output:</p>
   
<p class="php_container">
<span class="php_keyword">include&nbsp;</span><span class="php_string">"brainfuck.php"</span><span class="php_keyword">;
<br />
<br />echo&nbsp;</span><span class="php_default">brainfuck</span><span class="php_keyword">(
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="php_string">"&gt;++++[&lt;++++++++++++++++&gt;-]&lt;++++++++.&gt;++[&lt;++++++++++++++++&gt;-]&lt;---.+++++++..+++.
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;&gt;+++++[&lt;----------------&gt;-]&lt;+.&gt;+++[&lt;++++++++++++++++&gt;-]&lt;+++++++.++++++++++++++
<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;++++++++++.+++.------.--------."
<br /></span><span class="php_keyword">);</span>
</p>
   
  <p class="text">The main difference from this parser to others is the noninteractive nature of PHP. I
    decided an input string to simulate keyboard input. The input string is simply a stack of characters
	where I successively read out characters every time the script requests an input. If this stack is
	empty (i.e. the end of the input string is reached) the interpreter will start sending
	ASCII-character 0, which usually stops loops that require your input.</p>
  
<p class="php_container">
<span class="php_keyword">include&nbsp;</span><span class="php_string">"brainfuck.php"</span><span class="php_keyword">;
<br />
<br />echo&nbsp;</span><span class="php_default">brainfuck</span><span class="php_keyword">(</span><span class="php_string">"+[&gt;,]&lt;-[+.&lt;-]"</span><span class="php_keyword">,&nbsp;</span><span class="php_string">"Was it a car or a cat I saw?"</span><span class="php_keyword">);
<br /></span>
</p>

  <p class="text">This BF script outputs it's input in reverse order. As this sentence is a palindrome, it should read
    the same backwards.</p>

  <p class="text">For scripts which require for example a return key to be pressed, just add a <span class="notice">chr(10)</span>
    at the end. The ASCII-character '10' stands for line-feed (=return key). You could simulate every ASCII character
	with <a href="http://php.net/chr" target="_blank">chr</a> (strings in PHP are binary-safe). Make sure you have
	a good <a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~jc1/serial/Resources/ASCII.html" target="_blank">ASCII-chart</a>, otherwise
	you are lost.</p>

  <p class="smalltitle">Syntax</p>
  
  <p class="text">Brainfuck's syntax is very easy to learn. There are only eight instructions, as already mentioned. Here's the
    overview I borrowed from the official brainfuck documentation:</p>
	
  <div align="center">
  <table cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0" border="0">
  <tr>
    <td class="text">
  <pre class="bf_container">Cmd  Effect 				Equivalent in C
---  ------				    ---------------
+    Increases element under pointer	    array[p]++;
-    Decrases element under pointer	    array[p]--;
>    Increases pointer			    p++;
<    Decreases pointer			    p--;
[    Starts loop, counter under pointer     while(array[p]) {
]    Indicates end of loop		    }
.    Outputs ASCII code under pointer	    putchar(array[p]);
,    Reads char and stores ASCII under ptr  array[p]=getchar();</p></td>
  </tr>
  </table>
  </div>
  
  <p class="text">All other characters are ignored, thus comments can directly be embedded into
    BF scripts. My interpreter also supports the debug character '#' which will call an external
	PHP function called 'brainfuck_debug()'. This function can be customized by you to output
	whatever seems important to you. By default it will output all array elements (pointers) which
	have been used during the script execution including their values and representing ASCII-characters.</p>
  
  <p class="text">If this makes sense to you, jump to the tutorial, otherwise read on.</p>
  
  <p class="text">Brainfuck's memory is an array of chars. A char is a data type which can hold one byte, thus
    a numerical value from 0 to 255. A char can represent a character in your
	<a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~jc1/serial/Resources/ASCII.html" target="_blank">character table</a>
	(hence the name 'char'). A character can be either a letter or a digit, or it can also represent special
	characters such as line-feed or tab. Just have a quick look at the character table above showing
	the ASCII-character set (which is a subset of all possible characters - the usage of the remaining 128
	characters varies).</p>
  
  <p class="text">While the original implementation of brainfuck had a fixed number of array elements (30'000)
    implementing this in my interpreter, which supports arrays of dynamic size, felt artificial. Also, the number
	30'000 neither seems to represent a logical boundary, nor does it seem to crash existing scripts by leaving it out
	(at least, this is my assumption). Checking whether you are still within the 30'000 boundary would mean a
	serious impact on performance and leaving it out looks like a logical decision to me.</p>
  
  <p class="text">Now let's get started.</p>
  
  <p class="text">The first four commands are obvious: There are two commands which allow you to move
    backwards '&lt;' and forward '&gt;' in this array. In C, pointers and arrays are closely related,
	hence the 'increase/decrease pointer' above. As a PHP programmer you should be more familiar with
	<span class="notice">array key</span> or <span class="notice">array index</span>. A '&gt;' would
	therefore move you from $a[0] to $a[1].</p>
  
  <p class="text">The next two commands increase '+' or decrease '-' the value at the current
    index. An unused element always starts at 0. A BF command like '+++' would set $a[0] to 3.</p>
  
  <p class="text">A loop is delimited by '[' and ']'. A loop runs until the value of the current
    element is 0. If it is already 0, the whole loop is skipped (including nested loops). As you
	see, it exactly behaves like while(), where the appropriate condition would be
	<span class="notice">while($a[p] != 0)</span>. The following BF script first sets the current
	element to 3, then runs the loop 3 times until it is 0 again: +++[-]. A statement like [] would
	be an infinite loop (in case the current element is not 0), thus a script which would run
	endlessly looks like: +[].</p>
  
  <p class="text">The last two commands are required for user interaction. The comma ',' reads one
    character and puts it's numerical value into the current register. The dot '.' outputs the
	current character. A BF script like ',.' reads a character, then outputs it.</p>
	
  <p class="text">Don't be frustrated if you didn't understand everything perfectly - I tried to be
    very brief here. Follow the tutorial to get a more hands-on introduction to the language.</p>
 
  <p class="smalltitle">Tutorial</p>

  <p class="text">Let us start with the ubiquitous "Hello World" script. We have to look up the numerical value
    for every letter and then print them out. You can either use the
	<a href="http://www.mindspring.com/~jc1/serial/Resources/ASCII.html" target="_blank">ASCII-chart</a>
	or the PHP function <a href="http://php.net/ord" target="_blank">ord()</a>.
	<span class="notice">ord('H')</span> returns 72, thus we have to increment the current value to 72.
	This is done by writing '+' 72 times and then output this character with a dot. 
	</p>
  
  <p class="bf_container">
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text">The next character, 'e' has an ordinal value of 101, thus we have to increase the
    current value by another 29.</p>
  
  <p class="bf_container">
  ++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.<br>
  +++++++++++++++++++++++++++++.
  </p>
  
  <p class="text">This would already output "He". But before we follow this tedious pattern, let's start
    over. We will now make use of loops.</p>
  
  <p class="bf_container">
    +++++++[-]
  </p>
  
  <p>Now this is a loop which gets executed 7 times, but it does nothing useful. We want to store this value
    somewhere:</p>
  
  <p class="bf_container">
    +++++++[-<span class="bf_important">&gt;+&lt;</span>]
  </p>
  
  <p class="text">Inside the loop, we first jump to the next element $a[1], increment it by one, then jump back to the
    counter element $a[0]. It is necessary to be at the counter-element $a[0] at the end of the loop ']', because its value
	decides whether the loop gets executed one again or not.</p>
  
  <p class="text">What we did could either be described as "moving element 0 to element 1" or "adding element 0
    to element 1" (although the initial value for the first addend gets lost). Both are correct - it only depends
	on how you look at it. Now add two debug characters to illustrate this:</p>
  
  <p class="bf_container">
    +++++++<span class="bf_important">#</span>[-&gt;+&lt;]<span class="bf_important">#</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="text">A multiplication of 7 by 10 could be described as a repetitive addition of 10 which occurs 7 times.
    In brainfuck, this looks like this:</p>
  
  <p class="bf_container">
    +++++++[-&gt;<span class="bf_important">++++++++++</span>&lt;]
  </p>
  
  <p class="text">This will result in the value 70 in the second element. Add 2 and we have 'H':</p>
  
  <p class="bf_container">
    +++++++[-&gt;++++++++++&lt;]<span class="bf_important">&gt;++.</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="text">Adding the remaining letters is analogous, thus not anymore discussed here - try it for yourself.</p>
  
  <p class="text">You now already know how to move a value from a register to another, how to add two numbers and
    how a multiplication works - although you can currently only operate in a range between 0 and 255. Using bigger
	numbers would require to combine two (or more) registers (which is not covered here).</p>
  
  <p class="text">The next thing worth doing is reacting to user input. We will read everything the user inputs,
    then output it in the same order, i.e. "echo" it back.</p>
  
  <p class="bf_container">
  <span class="bf_important">&gt;</span>
  </p>

  <p class="text">The first thing to do is to leave the first element to 0. This is important when 'rewinding' the
    pointer, as you will see afterwards (the loop will stop there).</p>
  
  <p class="bf_container">
  &gt;<span class="bf_important">+</span>
  </p>
 
  <p class="text">The following loop has to be executed at least once, thus we have to set the current element to
    non-zero.</p>
	
  <p class="bf_container">
  &gt;+<span class="bf_important">[&gt;,]</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="text">This will read all user input. The loop is executed as long as the current element (=the character
    the user has entered) is non-zero. As already mentioned before, my interpreter starts sending the zero value as
	soon as the end of the input string is reached, thus you don't have to explicitly add <span class="notice">chr(0)</span>
	at the end of your input string.</p>
  
  <p class="text">Now would be a good time to call the debug function. The first elements are our helper-elements,
    followed by whatever you entered and terminated by a zero value. We now want to rewind the pointer to the beginning:</p>
  
  <p class="bf_container">
  &gt;+[&gt;,]<span class="bf_important">&lt;[&lt;]</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="text">We first move to the last character entered by the user, then move back until the current
    element equals 0. You guessed it - this loop stops at the first element we intentionally left empty.
	Now skip the first two characters as we don't want to output them:</p>
  
  <p class="bf_container">
  &gt;+[&gt;,]&lt;[&lt;]<span class="bf_important">&gt;&gt;</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="text">And finally output everything:</p>
  
  <p class="bf_container">
  &gt;+[&gt;,]&lt;[&lt;]&gt;&gt;<span class="bf_important">[.&gt;]</span>
  </p>
  
  <p class="text">Now it's up to you to create your own scripts. There are some more examples in the
    <a href="examples/">/examples/</a> directory of the interpreter package (some which I wrote myself, some I got from the
	internet (always credited)). Also have a look at the links I selected for you. There are plenty
	of examples which demonstrate more complex calculations (Pi, prime numbers ..) or explain various
	aspects of brainfuck.</p>
  
  <p class="text">Have fun!</p>
